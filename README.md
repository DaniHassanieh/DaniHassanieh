Hi, I’m Daniel "Dani" Hassanieh!
I’m interested in software engineering and computer science, and I will be going to the University of Texas at Dallas soon!
I’m currently learning python and java!
I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can to improve my skills in the future!
You can reach me at dhassanieh#0508 on discord and @d_hassanieh on twitter!
